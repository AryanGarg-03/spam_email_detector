# Spam Email Detector using Machine Learning & Gmail API

A beginner-friendly project to detect spam messages using NLP + Machine Learning.

---

### ✅ Features:
- Trained a **Naive Bayes classifier** on SMS spam dataset with **97% accuracy**
- Preprocessed text using **NLTK** (stopwords removal, stemming, etc.)
- Vectorized messages using **CountVectorizer**
- Integrated with **Gmail API** to:
  - Read recent emails
  - Predict if they are spam
  - Automatically move spam to Gmail’s Spam folder

---

### 💡 What I did:
- 📚 Learned and built the ML model from scratch
- 🔎 Cleaned & processed real data myself
- 🛠️ Gmail API integration was done with external help (authentication, scopes, etc.)
